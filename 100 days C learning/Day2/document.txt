snprintf is a function in C used for formatting and writing data to a string. It stands for "safe" or "secure" sprintf, which is another function that performs similar tasks but does not provide bounds checking, potentially leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. snprintf ensures that the output string does not exceed a specified buffer size, thereby reducing the risk of buffer overflow.

Here's how snprintf works:

Syntax:
c
Copy code
int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
Parameters:
str: Pointer to the destination buffer where the formatted string will be written.
size: Maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, including the null-terminator. It limits the total number of characters that will be written to str.
format: A format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are formatted and inserted into the resulting string.
...: Additional arguments to be formatted and inserted into the string according to the format string.
Return Value:
On success, snprintf returns the number of characters written (excluding the null-terminator).
If the output was truncated due to the specified size limit, snprintf returns the number of characters that would have been written if there were no size restriction (excluding the null-terminator).
If an error occurs, snprintf returns a negative value.
Working:
snprintf formats the input arguments according to the format string and writes the resulting string to the destination buffer (str).

It ensures that the output does not exceed the specified buffer size (size). If the formatted string would exceed the buffer size, snprintf truncates the output to fit within the buffer.

If the output is truncated, snprintf writes as much of the formatted string as possible within the size limit, ensuring that the resulting string is null-terminated.

snprintf always null-terminates the output string, even if it was truncated.

Example:
c
Copy code
char buffer[20];
int num_written = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "The answer is %d.", 42);
In this example:

buffer is the destination buffer.
sizeof(buffer) specifies the maximum size of the buffer.
"The answer is %d." is the format string.
42 is the value to be inserted into the formatted string.
num_written will contain the number of characters written to the buffer.
snprintf ensures that the resulting string does not exceed the buffer size (including the null-terminator), preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

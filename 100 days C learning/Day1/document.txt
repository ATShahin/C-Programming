Learning objectives: Scope of variables

1. Understand the use of static keyword and its advantages
2. Understand the use of extern keyword and how it helps in accessing/modifying the variable in main file from 
   an external file -> #include "file.h" in main.c file.
3. Additionally understand the use of const keyword


Modify the keywords and try:

1. Try changing the u16Year value to 2024 and then compile. You will see errors
2. Remove the const keyword and compile again. you will not see any errors

const static unsigned int u16Year=2023;

const static char version[]= "V00.00";

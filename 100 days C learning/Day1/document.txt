Learning objectives: Scope of variables

1. Understand the use of static keyword and its advantages
2. Understand the use of extern keyword and how it helps in accessing/modifying the variable in main file(variablescope.c) from 
   an external file -> #include "file.h" 
3. Additionally understand the use of const keyword


Modify the keywords and try:

Test for using the keyword static and without static
const static unsigned int u16Year=2023; -> unsigned int u16Year=2023;
1. Remove the keyword static, const from this line(given above) and include the code given in file.h by removing the /* and */
   The extern keyword in file.h exposes the variable u16Year to outside the file it was originally designed. Therefore, it could be       
   modified from file.h
2. uncomment the function // function1(); inside the main function.This modifies the u16Year value to 2024.
2. With static keyword, the variable u16Year scope is limited to the main file and not exposed to outside.

With static and with out const keyword
const static unsigned int u16Year=2023; -> unsigned int u16Year=2023;
1. Try changing the u16Year value to 2024 with in the main function and then compile. You will see errors
2. Remove the const keyword and compile again. you will not see any errors

The above test can also be done using the below line from variablescope.c (main file)

const static char version[]= "V00.00";

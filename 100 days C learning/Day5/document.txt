This program shows how a string can be copied in a array in reverse order.

The algorithm is as follows 

1. Find the number of characters in the string
2. copy the characters from the last location (n-1) to 0 to 0 to n of the character array
  n-1 because n is null character
Hint:the number of array/string locations should match
array[0] = string[n-1]
.
.
.
array[n] = string[0]
